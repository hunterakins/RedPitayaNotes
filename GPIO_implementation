GPIO:

Memory mapping:

Seems that peripheral base address in virtual address space is from 0

Writing to a pin is as expected:
#define iowrite32(v, p) (*(volatile uint32_t *)(p) = (v)) 

int rp_GPIOpSetState(uint32_t state) {
	iowrite32(state, &hk->ex_co_p);


Okay, but where does hk come from?
hk is a struct defined in housekeeping.h
It is initialized by hk_Init (contained inside rp_Init)

The meat of it, however, is the memory map, defined in common.c

int cmn_Map(size_t size, size_t offset, void ** mapped)
{
	blah blah
	*mapped = mmap(NULL, size, PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE, MAP_SHARED, fd, offset);	

	blah blah 
}

where fd is 
fd = open("/dev/uio/api", O_RDWR | O_SYNC)
